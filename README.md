“ Shawn broker is a company that deals in home loans in London. They have their presence in 32 London borough councils in London. When customers approach them for a loan, they validate the credibility of the customers which will determine their eligibility for a loan. The volume of loan they process is on geometric increase, hence automating the process involved in accessing the loan eligibility in real-time is a necessity in with the information customers have already provided when they filled the application form. The entry in the form includes gender, marriage status, education qualification or level, number of person living with them, annual income, loan amount being requested, credit worthy of the applicant. Automating the process is possible, however, they have a challenge that needs to be tackled first, which is to understand the customer features qualified for loan and the amount which will help them to specify their target customers. This forms the basis of my research question”.
